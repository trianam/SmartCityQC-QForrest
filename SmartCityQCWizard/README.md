# Quantum Code Challenge Hackathon / Smart City QC Wizard Challenge
Quantum Code Challenge Hackathon for Smart Cities at CTE - Cagliari Digital Lab

[Quantum Code Challenge](https://www.cagliaridlab.it/en/event.page?contentId=EVT881) is a entirely online hackathon on quantum computing applied to smart cities in the [CTE Cagliari DLAB](https://www.cagliaridlab.it/) project framework, organised by [CRS4](https://www.crs4.it/) in collaboration with [Open Campus](https://www.opencampus.it/) and with the endorsement of [Qitaly](https://qworld.net/qitaly/), the italian representative among the national active groups of the QWorld organization.
The event takes place entirely online from 22 to 25 October 2024!

## Project Participation Rules and Guidelines
To ensure a smooth and fair experience for all participants, please carefully read and adhere to the following rules and guidelines.

### Eligibility:
  1. To participate in the project, you must be successfully enrolled in the [Quantum Code Challenge Hackathon](https://www.cagliaridlab.it/it/event.page?contentId=EVT881) 
  2. All nationalities, genders, and age groups are welcome to participate in the projects.

### Project Work Period:
  1. Work on your team repository from **October 22, 2024** to **October 25, 2024**.
  2. Fork/duplicate the repository of your selected project. This forked/duplicated repository will be referred to as your _"Team repository"_.
  3. Ensure your repository is public at the time of submission for judging purposes. All work inside your team repository will be considered the final submission for the project.

### Project Submission:
  1. Submit your team repository by **October 25, 2024, 3:00pm CET DST**.
  2. Add the GitHub submission link (public link of your Team repository) on the form that will be provided.
  3. Do not modify your team repository after the deadline. Any modifications after the submission deadline may lead to disqualification.

### Final session:
  1. Project finalists will be announced on October 25, 2024 at 4pm CET DST.
  2. Finalists present 2min. project deck on **The final session, October 25, 2024 at 4pm CET DST**.
  3. Winners will be announced on Demo Day, October 25, 2024.


## Code of Conduct
  - Maintain the highest standards of ethical conduct throughout the project period. Any form of cheating, harassment, or misconduct will lead to disqualification and potential banning from future events. Maintain professionalism and respect in all interactions with fellow participants and the Womanium team.
  - Respect intellectual property rights. Ensure that all work submitted is original and properly referenced if using third-party resources. Plagiarism or the use of unauthorized material will result in immediate disqualification.
  - Adhere strictly to all deadlines. Late submissions will not be accepted.

By participating in the Smart City QC Wizard Code Challenge, you agree to comply with all the rules and guidelines outlined above. Good Luck!


# Challenge Scenario
The municipality needs a way to detect potential alert situations 

The alerts can be of different degrees, so quantum machine learning in the future might be the best option to find patterns in data and start the alert procedure.  

The dataset is quite heterogeneous, it provides different sensor streams that will be described below. 

Participants are absolutely free to single out a set of different acquisitions and  build their Quantum Machine Learning application to provide alerts useful for the Municipality . 

Universal and adiabatic quantum computing solutions are welcome. The Qbraid portal will provide the availability of the NEC Vector Annealer Service digital annealer for the teams who wish to develop an adiabatic solution. You will be asked to fill a form if you decide to use this resource

Both supervised and unsupervised learning approaches are welcome, up to you. If you choose supervised learning, you are in charge for singling out the subset of data and creating the labels.

# Submission guidelines
- Teams submit their solution in a public github repository that might be a fork of the CRS4 repository for the challenge.
- In the readme file they will list the name of the team members, their email, their github id and their discord id.  
- We suggest using a dual license (like a MIT one) at the moment of the repository creation in order to allow reuse while maintaining copyright. (It’s easier for each team to commercialize their project later if they develop a very smart solution).
- In the repository, the readme from the original QCWizard repo must be enclosed and completed with the missing data. 
-The submission repository will contain the data subset, all source codes and results and a slide deck that describes the solution.
- Participants will be asked to quote other’s work usage appropriately.
